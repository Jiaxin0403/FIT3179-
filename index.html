            <h4>
                The Australian bushfire has been devastating. It has caused massive loss of wildlife, forest land, and
                has even to led human casualties. There have been huge undertakings by the fire department on
                controlling the bushfire and recovery activity.
                Thanks to NASA the satellite data by MODIS and VIIRS , near real-time data is made available publically.
                With Fire still active, with the latest one near capital city of Canberra.
                The purpose of putting this dataset here is to gain useful insights from this data and make it available
                to everyone.

                    In 2019, the combined effects of long-term warming, insufficient rainfall and abnormal ocean
                    circulation
                    made Australia's ground conditions extremely prone to fires
                    The bushfires swept through many parts of the Australian continent, burning in the north and
                    moving
                    to
                    the more populous southern and southeastern regions
                    The fire mainly occurred on the southeast coast of Australia, which is the most densely
                    populated
                    area
                    of the continent

                    September 2019 was the month with the least number of fires, but with the advent of November and
                    December, the number of fires increased sharply.
                    Although the number of fires in late November has a downward trend, after entering December, the
                    overall
                    increase has occurred.
                    The proportion of fires occurring during the day continues to increase. This shows that with dry
                    climates and rising temperatures, the risk of fires is getting higher and higher.

                    There is no strong correlation between the power of the fire and the area of the flame.
                    Even the duration of the fire has a weak correlation with power and area.
                    We can see that small fires are unusually frequent and frequent. These small fires and small fires
                    constitute a continuous fire in Australia. They have brought great difficulties to the rescue.
                    It also caused the environment to suffer greater pollution.
